JSON.parse is recursive

Its litterally calling itself inside a function
function cat(){
    function cat(){

    }
}


The Stack 
-Any function invoced will put on the top of the call stack 
-When javascript see reuturn the complier will remove
-Pretty much when a function is invoved its added to a queue and removed when a return statement happens

Important things for a recursive function
1. Base Case or when it should stop 
2. Diffrent Input or the diffrent stuff we add 


Pitfalls with Recursion 
1. If you don't have base case set up correctly it will error out 
2. Make sure you add return something or it will not work
