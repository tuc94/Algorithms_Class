JSON.parse is recursive

Its litterally calling itself inside a function
function cat(){
    function cat(){

    }
}


The Stack 
-Any function invoced will put on the top of the call stack 
-When javascript see reuturn the complier will remove
-Pretty much when a function is invoved its added to a queue and removed when a return statement happens

Important things for a recursive function
1. Base Case or when it should stop 
2. Diffrent Input or the diffrent stuff we add
